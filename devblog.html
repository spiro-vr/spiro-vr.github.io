								<p>Our project has a couple of specifications required by our class, EECS 498: Extended
									Reality and Society. Each week for the remainder of development, we will try to
									address these specifications and how we have made progress
									in them. Here are the specifications:
								</p>
								<p><b>1. Technical Sophistication</b>: Does the software accomplish significant tasks
									with few bugs?</p>

								<p><b>2. Novelty</b>: Does the software accomplish something rare and non-trivial?</p>
								<p><b>3. Social Impact</b>: Does the software accomplish something impactful beyond the
									purely-recreational?
								</p>
								<p><b>4. XR Emphasis</b>: Does the software utilize VR or AR to its fullest extent in a
									way 2D couldn’t replicate?</p>
								<p><b>5. Financial Sustainability</b>: Does the software / website identify a clear path
									to long-term financial health?</p>

								<h3>Technical Sophistication</h3>
								<p>This week was mainly focused on the hardware side of our project. In order for our
									project to function, we needed access to a digital spirometer. These are pricey, so
									we decided to go the custom hardware route.</p>
								<p>None of us have much experience with custom circuit design, so the first step of this
									was to get familiar with microcontrollers. For this project, we used an Arduino Nano
									(shoutout to Téa’s housemate, Dev, who let her borrow
									the circuitry needed to get the project rolling— it would have been impossible to do
									it without them!!).
								</p>
								<h4>Spirometer Design</h4>
								<p>There are a few DIY spirometer tutorials online. The ones we used were:
									<a href="https://www.instructables.com">Low Cost Spirometer : 5 Steps (with
										Pictures)Instructables › Workshop › Science</a> <a href="https://maker.pro">DIY
										Arduino Nano SpirometerMaker
										Pro › arduino › tutorial › diy-arduino-nano…</a>
								</p>
								<p>We managed to get a device working this week that reads air pressure in pascals.
									Ideally, we need to convert this pressure unit into a volume unit, to measure lung
									capacity like a true spirometer, but a pressure measurement
									should work for now.</p>
								<img src="images/1.1.png" alt="pic1" />
								<p>Here is a diagram of the reference circuit that we used:
								</p>
								<img src="images/1.2.png" alt="pic2" />
								<p>Here is the circuit we came up with at the end. Note we did not include some of the
									components shown above, as we really only needed the data output from the pressure
									sensor, and not any of the bells and whistles:
								</p>
								<img src="images/circuit.gif" width="900" alt="pic3" />
								<p>Most of the components of this circuit are borrowed, but the vital component of this
									project is the differential pressure sensor, the MPX5010DP pressure sensor, which
									had to be bought online.
								</p>
								<p>Finally, we needed to create the mouthpiece for the spirometer to attach to the
									pressure sensor. A typical spirometer has an intricate mouthpiece designed for
									accuracy of measurement. Due to cost limitations, we did not
									have a super intricate design. The mouthpiece ended up being two nested PVC pipes
									with vinyl tubing attached to the two ends of the PVC tube.
								</p>
								<img src="images/1.4.png" width="700" alt="pic4" />
								<img src="images/1.3.png" width="500" alt="pic3" />
								<p>With that, the design of the spirometer was finished for the week!
								</p>
								<h3>Novelty & Social Impact</h3>
								<p>Our goal with this project is to bring some enthusiasm into something that is
									typically dreaded: hospital visits. Spirometry games already exist— this we know.
									But for patients who regularly visit the pulmonary unit, providing
									a unique and entertaining way to interface with a routine medical exam makes the
									overall experience at the doctor’s office less of a stressor in daily life.</p>
								<p>We particularly see a benefit for pediatric patients who may be uneasy about going to
									appointments. We hope that SpiroVR can provide meaningful distraction to an
									otherwise stressful experience.
								</p>
								<h3>VR Emphasis</h3>
								<p>Unlike a regular spirometry game, our experience will have ways to spatially interact
									with the virtual environment— mechanics like aiming your breath output allow the VR
									emphasis shine.</p>
								<h3>Financial Sustainability</h3>
								<p>We would like to create a model where we can contract with hospitals to provide a
									better testing experience. With the contract, the addition of new minigames on a
									schedule would allow the content to be fresh and the cash
									flow to be sustainable.
								</p>

								<h2 id="w2">Week 2</h2>
								<p>Welcome to week 2 of SpiroVR development!</p>
								<h3>Technical Sophistication</h3>
								<p>To start off the week, we connected the mouthpiece that we constructed last week to
									our Unity project using Ardity, a plugin that allows the engine to interface with an
									arduino.
								</p>
								<p>Within our application, we developed a modular and complete menu system that allows
									for easy customization and templating. We also started prototyping minigames that
									take advantage of our unique control scheme, including
									a breathing-based archery mini game, which consists of different rounds of moving
									targets increasing in distance and speed.
								</p>

								<p>Outside of the hardware and the application, the website went through somewhat of a
									redesign with a new color scheme, layout and “people” tab, listing the members of
									our group. The website is still incomplete, but is coming
									together fast!</p>
								<h3>Novelty & Societal Impact</h3>
								<p>On Friday, we met with Dr. Antonia Popova (Téa’s personal pulmonologist). Dr. Popova
									is a pediatric pulmonologist so we wanted to hear her thoughts on what we were
									making. Her answers were extremely insightful, but the
									most important piece of information that she gave us was her thoughts on the
									potential real-world marketing and distribution of the software.
								</p>
								<p>A spirometry test, while a measure of lung strength and capacity, measures a lot of
									different statistics and data, much of which requires precise, carefully calibrated
									sensors. Because of this, there are a lot of guidelines
									and restrictions to follow, and since the tests are not taken often, there is
									limited need for upgraded spirometry equipment in medical settings. However, Dr.
									Popova also had suggestions for another possible market.
									Airway clearance is a vital maintenance tool for patients with pulmonary conditions
									such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Many of
									these patients need to sit multiple times each day
									and practice breathing exercises to keep their lungs clear. Dr. Popova believed that
									our application, with how easy VR could be to get set up at home, could create an
									appealing way to make the process of undergoing
									these breathing exercises much more engaging and make it easier to keep up with.</p>
								<h3>VR Emphasis</h3>
								<p>After this conversation, we determined that it may be more helpful to create a system
									that could, in the future, be test and/or device agnostic, and rather function as a
									general purpose lung health app. In the meantime,
									we will focus our project on airway clearance, and create minigames that utilize the
									Huff Coughing Technique (to clear mucus).</p>
								<h3>Finanical Sustainability</h3>
								<p>The financial plan remains similar to that of last week, and while we still plan to
									contract with hospitals to provide a better testing experience, we now also envision
									our products at the homes of our users who frequently
									have to practice airway clearance. This can happen through the hospital or
									direct-to-consumer.
